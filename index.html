<ul>
<li>Applying Permaculture idea(l) to docs:

<ul>
<li>Observe, Design, Evolve</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Project Planning: Patterns

<ul>
<li>When planning projects, you’re using what you’ve got to reach your goals.</li>
<li>If living systems have natural proclivities, what are the proclivities of your group?

<ul>
<li>This is a restatement of a basic leadership idea: know your people, know your strengths and weaknesses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design

<ul>
<li>Zones are ‘areas of access’ in permaculture.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>, the mozilla developer network, is an OS wiki; relies upon the community</li>
<li>MDN is trying to doc everything that matters to developers. This is difficult since the web is big. (This means that MDN is big, too.)</li>
<li>Leveraging the power of the community lets MDN document as much as it does. There's paid staff and there's community.</li>
<li>Benefit of community is that it gives you a wide range of experience, opinions, backgrounds. This lets you know what matters to users (and users in different contexts).</li>
<li>Important to see users as <em>peers</em>; they're not your minions. (Great word, Ali.)

<ul>
<li>Users are 'partners on a journey'.</li>
<li>You don't offload crappy work on them, you don't <em>tell</em> them what to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide opportunity.

<ul>
<li>If you say 'Hey, X needs some documentation', people are likely to take you up on it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intrinsic (internal) motivation is important

<ul>
<li>Users will help because they want to, because they feel pleasure from doing so.</li>
<li>People like contributing their expertise to a large audience of peers.

<ul>
<li>e.g. Burning Man</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Three Elements of Motivation:

<ol>
<li>Autonomy</li>
<li>Mastery</li>
<li>Purpose</li>
<li>Check out the book <em>Drive</em> for more about motivation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The importance of values

<ul>
<li>Values (clearly stated) give communities something around which to coalesce.</li>
<li>Clearly these need to be organically developed.</li>
<li>If your company adheres to and exemplifies these values, this makes it part of the community, not some asshole in a suit treating the community members like unpaid idiot minions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collaboration helps you to avoid making wrong decisions.

<ul>
<li>If users don't want to do it, maybe it isn't the right thing to do.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There isn't necessarily one best way to build a community.

<ul>
<li>What are you passionate about? How can you share that passion with others?</li>
<li>What opportunities can you provide to the community?</li>
<li>How can you create community?</li>
<li>How can you bring more people in?</li>
<li>What opportunities can the community bring to you?</li>
</ul>

</h3>

<ul>
<li>People who are have innate understanding of materials often aren't the ones who are the best at explaining it.</li>
<li>How do you learn an existing codebase? Read the code, look @ user-facing documentation, ask sr engineers questions.

<ul>
<li>Reading code is good (tells you how &amp; what), but not <em>why</em>? (e.g. What was the developer's intention in writing the code the way it is written?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Internal documentation helps a company to avoid growing pain, scaling both horizontally and vertically.

<ul>
<li>If you've got (good) technical docs, it's easier for new engineers to hit the ground running.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lessons:

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Write Anything</strong>

<ul>
<li>Once something exists, it can be massaged into something good.</li>
<li>That cliche about not letting <em>perfection</em> being the enemy of <em>existing</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Find your allies</strong>

<ul>
<li>Don't believe that you're confused because you're stupid/a n00b/whatever else that's negative.</li>
<li>If you're confused, others probably are, too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Spread out the work</strong> content, format, critique

<ul>
<li>When you teach, you learn.</li>

</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hey, meeting minutes are important. Someone should be keeping them.</li>
<li>During meetings, <a href="http://rohdesign.com/book/">sketchnotes</a> are fun but not always productive.</li>
<li>Meeting notes shouldn't just barf back what was said. (regurgitation -&gt; curation)</li>
<li>So how should you keep meeting notes?

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Understand your audience</strong> Who isn't there?

<ul>
<li>Who will need to read these notes?</li>
<li>Why will they read them?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Shared Need</strong>

<ul>
<li>What will people get the most from?

<ul>
<li>eg Avoid chronology. Frontload the important stuff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Write the Facts</strong>

<ul>
<li>Meeting minutes should include what's important. You're not a courtroom stenographer; you can summarize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Engage your subject matter experts</strong>

<ul>
<li>Before publication, ask experts questions about your minutes. That'll help you to clarify, qualify, classify.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Make your action items clear</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Use collaborative tools</strong>

<ul>
<li>Makes it easy to fix mistakes, typos, &amp;c</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Use templates to save time</strong></li>
<li><strong>Always tell: Who, Where, What</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Easter Eggs</strong>

<ul>
<li>Adding in fun stuff will make people read your notes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exceptions:

<ul>
<li>If your organization loves chronology, keep it.</li>
<li>If you <em>are</em> a courtroom stenographer, record everything.</li>
<li>If your org has a style guide, stick to it (until you can change it).</li>
</ul>

</h3>

<p><em>Or, what we can steal from programmers</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Documentation can be helped by giving writers a default framework in which to write/work.</li>
<li>Have templates for oft-written stuff: blog posts, references</li>
<li>Make sure you know what question a doc is trying to answer.</li>
<li>
<strong>make a spec</strong> for your doc and make sure everyone involved knows the specs.

<ul>
<li>what are the questions you're answering?</li>
<li>who is the audience?</li>
<li>what is the current state of documentation?

<ul>
<li>new content, existing content (including 3rd party docs)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>what's the work plan?

<ul>
<li>who owns it, who revises it?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>adapting the idea of <em>design patterns</em> to writing; start a doc with an architecture. examples:

<ul>
<li>
<strong>tell a story</strong> linear timeline (walkthrough)</li>
<li>
<strong>paint a picture</strong> spapshot (introduce feature/tool)</li>
<li>
<strong>reference</strong> introduce one at a time and describe</li>
<li>
<strong>theme + situation</strong> idea and use cases (intro to concept)</li>
<li>
<strong>drill down</strong> general -&gt; specific</li>
<li>
<strong>level up</strong> simple to complex (getting started.doc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Errors/name your variables

<ul>
<li>Undefined 'it'</li>
<li>No ownership (avoid magic. [that doesn't mean no django])</li>
<li>Vague terms (don't use generic tech terms)</li>
<li>Unnamed ideas</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idea of <em>refactoring</em> vs <em>editing</em>
</li>

<li>Seems like the 80/20 'principle' (editorial scarequotes there); a small segment of contributers put in the bulk of the work.</li>
<li>Book sprints!

<li>
<a href="http://openstack.org">OpenStack</a> flew in a whole bunch of writing volunteers and wrote the <em>OpenStack Operations Guide</em>, which wound up being published by O'Reilly.</li>

</h3>

<ul>
<li>Think about who the documentation is for.</li>
<li>Audience – set of knowledge people will come with.</li>
<li>Document according to audiences; e.g. new users and experts</li>
<li>Thinks that <em>straight line docs</em> are best; optional stuff can be linked. Trim the fat, it distracts.</li>
<li>No assumptions: e.g. no jargon.</li>
<li>It's fine to be prescriptive. You're an expert; share that expertise by informing the reader as to best practices. (Drowning readers in options is often, IMHO, a form of showbloating.)</li>
<li>Addressing <em>use cases</em> is great. Finding out what use cases the community wants/needs is probably difficult if you don't have a strong community. Good argument for not treating your community like minions/rubes, btw.</li>
<li>If users have to go to Stack Overflow to figure out your docs, your docs fail.</li>
<li>Learners often don't know what they don't know. The docs need to inform users of everything they ought to know.</li>
<li>Users asking 'How do I X?' is feedback on docs.</li>

<ul>
<li>What does it mean to do technical documentation (engineer to engineer)?</li>
<li>Treat docs like code; written by engineers</li>
<li>Wikis are messy. Not the best solution</li>
<li>If developers are writing code, <em>use the existing code workflow</em>.

<ul>
<li>Check in! Version, check, merge!</li>
<li>Harder for the writers, but much easier for the developers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">ReStructuredText</a></li>
<li>Made a plan. e.g. DocDay -&gt; Templates -&gt; DocBird (platform)</li>
<li>Thinking of documentation as a platform opens up all sort of cool possibilities.</li>
